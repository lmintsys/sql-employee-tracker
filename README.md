## Description

The aim of this project was to create an employee tracker that will allow users to manage a company's employee database. Specifically, the user will be able to view the tables that contain information on company's departments, roles, and employees database, update and delete entries as needed. This application provides a user-friendly interface to interact with a database. Working on this project helped me gaininng further understanding of how to create an interactive app outside the browser that communicates with the user, and allows for a database management.

## Installation

To create this app, Inquirer, MySQL2 and console.table packages were installed.

## Usage

When the app starts, a user is prompted with a menu that provides various options for interacting with the employees database. The user can view each of the three tables: departments, roles, and employees. Additionally, they can add rows to any of the tables, update either an employee's role or manager, and delete rows from any of the tables.
